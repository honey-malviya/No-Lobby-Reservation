# SourceMod Plugin: No Lobby ID Join Fix

## Description:
This SourceMod plugin addresses the issue where Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) dedicated servers using 'public' lobbies reject players who attempt to join without a lobby ID from Steam, resulting in the error message: 

```
server using 'public' lobbies, requiring pw no, lobby id ffffffffffffffff 
```

This plugin enables players to join the server directly without needing a lobby ID.

## Compatibility:
This plugin is compatible with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) dedicated servers running SourceMod.

## Dependencies:
- [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php)
- [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php)

## Installation:
1. Ensure you have Metamod:Source installed on your CSGO dedicated server.
2. Install SourceMod following the [official installation guide](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod).
3. Copy the files from this repository to your server files.
4. Restart your CSGO dedicated server.

## Configuration:
The plugin requires no additional configuration. Once installed and loaded, you should be able to connect to your server provided everything else is setup correctly.
